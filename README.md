The ".vercel" folder is created when you link a directory to a Vercel project.. The "project.json" file contains: - The ID of the Vercel project that you linked ("projectId") - The ID of the user or team your Vercel project is owned by ("orgId"). No, you should not share the ".vercel" folder with anyone.
